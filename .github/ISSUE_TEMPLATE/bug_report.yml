        üîç Please read [ast-grep FAQ](https://ast-grep.github.io/advanced/faq.html) before reporting a new bug as most bugs are very likely to be questions.
        Please fill in each section completely. Thank you!

        A link to a ast-grep Playground "Share" link which shows this behavior.
        This should have the same code as the code snippet below.
        As a last resort, you can link to a repo, but these will be slower for us to investigate.

        Please post the relevant code sample here as well.

        This code and the Playground code should be the same, do not use separate examples.

        We can quickly address your report if:

          - The code sample is short. Nearly all ast-grep issues can be demonstrated in 20-30 lines of code!
          - Remove unnecessary code/configuration. The simpler the code, the faster we can help.
          - The incorrectness of the behavior is readily apparent from reading the sample.

        Reports are slower to investigate if:

          - We have to pare too much extraneous code.
          - We have to clone a large repo and validate that the problem isn't elsewhere.
          - The sample is confusing or doesn't clearly demonstrate what's wrong.
